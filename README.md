# [Savelink](https://savelink.vercel.app)

# Why? - Project Overview
I realised i send links to myself to save a lot for future reference but they get lost when they aren't categorised properly and there's no standalone place to visit those links, so i thought it would be a cool idea to build a project around that to solve my problem and inprove my skills at the same time

# Technologies Used
- Next js : Fullstack framework
- Nextauth : for google authentication
- React Query : ease in data-fetching and caching
- Mongo DB & Mongoose : data storage, database querying and connection with Mongoose
- CSS

## Features I may add later
- Backing up data in google drive and retrieving later

## Run locally
