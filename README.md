# [Savelink](https://savelink.vercel.app)
A web app & PWA to safely store your favourite/important links from all across the web in one place, for ease of access and categorising.
# Why? — Project Overview
I realised i send links to myself to save a lot for future reference but they get lost when they aren't categorised properly and there's no standalone place to visit those links, so i thought it would be a cool idea to build a project around that to solve my problem and inprove my skills at the same time
